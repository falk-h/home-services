# make sure that your dns has a cname set for homeassistant and that your homeassistant container is not using a base url

# As of homeassistant 2021.7.0, it is now required to define the network range your proxy resides in, this is done in Homeassitants configuration.yaml
# https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http/#trusted_proxies
# Example below uses the default dockernetwork ranges, you may need to update this if you dont use defaults.
